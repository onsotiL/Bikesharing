# Bikesharing

This analysis can be viewed in Tableau at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lilian.onsoti)

The purpose of this project was to analyze bikesharing data from CitiBike in New York City for the purpose of implementing a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis focused on analyzing the CitiBike data to better determine the following 

- What are the most popular locations for bikers
- Who are the predominant bike users
- What are the most popular days and times for biking 

## Results

This worksheet displays the peak riding times by hour throughout the month of August. 
It is noted that the is very low usage during the hours of 12 AM and 5AM. This is a crucial piece of information as it can be used to determine the best time to perform bike repairs

This graph depicting the duration of trips shows that the majority of trips by CitiBike riders is under an one hour. This information is important in prediction the turnover and availability of bikes during a one-hour period

The map shows the starting locations for riders. The size of the circle and lightness/darkness of of color of the circle (black) indicates the number of trips that begun at that location. It can be deduced therefore that most starting locations are situated in densely populated areas such as touristic locations or commercial centers. This information is important as it will guide the Bike program being implemented Des Moines, Iowa on the best place to install bike stations.

## Summary
The analyzed data displayed in the charts clearly shows that a biking business is popular especially in densely populated urban areas. 

According to the data:
- majority of riders identify as male. 
- High usage is mostly during the morning and evening commute hours
- Popular starting locations for trips are in densely populated areas

## Recommendations
- Use population information to determine the best places to install ride stations
- Since most riders identify as male, find ways to attract more female riders
- Find ways to increase trips during low usage times (During the day)
- Find ways to increase number of rides in the suburbs or low population areas
