This analysis can be viewed in Tableau at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lilian.onsoti)

The purpose of this project was to analyze bikesharing data from CitiBike in New York City for the purpose of implementing a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis focused on analyzing the CitiBike data to better determine the following 

- What are the most popular locations for bikers
- Who are the predominant bike users
- What are the most popular days and times for biking 
-
